## Summary of Software
We are working with are the Computational biology laboratory, Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research. We are working with Professor, Principal Investigator Gary Bader (gary.bader@utoronto.ca) and Research Associate Jeffrey Wong (jvwong@gmail.com). The Donnelly Centre brings together scientists from diverse fields like systems biology, bioengineering, and computer science to advance genomic technology and computational biology for breakthroughs in science and medicine. With a research community of 550 members, the Centre addresses key challenges in basic science and human health while training future interdisciplinary researchers Hyper-Recent is a website designed to collect and showcase the most recent and relevant scientific papers for researchers. Developed in collaboration with the Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research, it addresses the need for a lightweight platform that highlights the latest papers, including pre-publication works. Given the delays in traditional publishing, where papers undergo lengthy review processes, existing resources like PubMed often lack the newest literature, and platforms like bioRxiv can be cluttered and difficult to navigate. The goal is to create a user-friendly site that provides access to the latest scientific research, even before official publication. The key features of the project are the following: topic-basd browsing, recent publications display, keyword filtering within topics, exclusion of keywords, date range filter, and sorting by popularity.
## Existing Software and Infrastructure
The Donnelly Centre has promised us access to a Virtual Machine for deploying the application and hosting our production version. However, we are still working on access and configuration of the machine. In addition, the Research Associates have provided us with their prototpye link at [https://hyper-recent.pages.dev/](https://hyper-recent.pages.dev/). There is also source code provided for the prototype which we have not used: [here](https://github.com/PathwayCommons/hyper-recent).

## Responsibility of Each Team
### D2 - 1
The D2-1 Team was responsible for the user story 2: as a user, I want to see the most recent publications within a topic in order to stay up to date with the latest findings. The acceptance criteria for this subteam was that the system displays the most recent publications when a topic is selected, and that publications are sorted by the most recent date by default. In short, our main objective was to display the home page, where articles would appear in a certain topic by the latest topic. The frontend team followed the Figma design created for D1. We used Tailwind CSS for predefined classes to style our elements and React for component-based architecture and virtual DOM. For example, since the subteam was responsible for displaying the latest articles, we put each of these articles key characteristics in a post item, and we put each of those Post items in a PostsList item. This PostsList item was also used as a component for the HomePage. The backend team used Node.js with Express.js and utilized PostgreSQL as the database. Prisma was used for Object-Relational Mapping to interact with the PostgreSQL database. The Prisma schema in schema.prisma defines models for Article, Topic, ArticleTopic, and SubTopic. The seeding script in seed.ts populates the database with dummy data from a JSON file. The API endpoint in route.ts fetches articles by topic using Prisma to query the database.

### D2 - 2
The D2-2 subteam was responsible for implementing the user story 3 which will allow users to refine their searches by entering specific keywords within a topic. This enables users to narrow the displayed results to only papers and articles that contain the specified terms in the search bar. This feature enhances the search experience by providing a more targeted way for users to find publications relevant to their research needs. The frontend team implemented the mockup designs that were agreed upon with the partner. We used Next.js with React client-side components and Tailwind CSS to ensure a responsive and visually appealing user interface. The page features a search bar with a button that enables users to filter articles by keyword. We implemented an API call function getFilterPosts to process these requests, parsing the keywords and sending them as parameters to retrieve the relevant articles. The backend team utilized PostgreSQL for the database and Prisma was employed for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to interact with the PostgreSQL database, with the models defined in the schema.prisma file. The necessary API endpoints were created to fetch articles based on the provided keywords. The API calls have been tested on the backend, and the frontend components have been tested using Vitest. The finished user story was then deployed using Heroku, and can be accessed from this link: https://hyper-recent-b799cb90f844.herokuapp.com/

### D2 - 3
This sub-team was responsible for the user story:
> As a user, I want to see and choose from a range of topics on the home page in order to browse publications under a specific topic.
