Despite utilizing a variety of transport methods, MFS transporters are believed to undergo similar con-formational changes within their distinct transport cycles. Although the similarities regarding conformational changes between the classes of MFS transporters are note-worthy, the differences are also valuable because they may explain the distinct functions of the classes within the MFS. Here, we have performed a variety of equilibrium and non-equilibrium all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the bacterial proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter (GkPOT) and the human glucose transporter 1 (GluT1). To compare the similarities and differences of the conformational dynamics found within the three different classes of transporters we have also referenced previous simulations involving the glycerol-3-phosphate (GlpT) transporter. All of the proteins discussed here were simulated in the apo state in explicit membrane environments. Our results suggest a very similar conformational transition for all transporter types involving interbundle salt-bridge formation/disruption coupled with the orientation changes of transmembrane (TM) helices, specifically H1/H7 and H5/H11, resulting in an alternation in the accessibility of water at the cyto- and periplasmic gates.\",\"isPreprint\":true,\"firstAuthorId\":1,\"lastAuthorId\":2,\"authorList\":\"Ogden, D.; Immadisetty, K.; Sauve, S.; Moradi, M.\",\"slug\":\"slug-default\",\"server\":\"biorxiv\"},{\"articleId\":5,\"title\":\"Oscillatory multi-timescale mechanisms underlying multisensory sequence prediction\",\"institution\":\"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf\",\"date\":\"2024-10-29T01:55:19.099Z\",\"link\":\"10.1101/778969\",\"abstract\":\"Neural oscillations have been proposed to be involved in predictive processing, however less addressed in the multisensory context. In the present study, we recorded cortical activity using magnetoencephalography during an audiovisual serial prediction task in which participants had to acquire stimulus sequences and to monitor whether subsequent probe items complied with the sequence. In a given trial, either visual or auditory features of the bimodal stimuli were task-relevant. Task-related changes of power and coupling of neural oscillations were analyzed using a data-driven clustering approach. We observed prediction-related theta-band coupling in a network involving the cingulate, premotor, prefrontal, and superior temporal regions. The behavioral performance of participants varied as a function of the phase delay of the coupling between different regions in this network. Two additional clusters were detected in which beta power was stronger if the previous or the following stimuli were the same as the current one in the sequence. These clusters interacted with the theta-band prediction network through cross-frequency coupling. Our results offer novel insights into the multi-timescale neural dynamics underlying multisensory predictions, suggesting that oscillations in multiple frequency ranges, as well as coupling within and across frequencies, may be critical for multisensory sequence processing.\",\"isPreprint\":true,\"firstAuthorId\":1,\"lastAuthorId\":2,\"authorList\":\"Wang, P.; Maÿe, A.; Daume, J.; Xue, G.; Engel, A.

In this study, we carried out a microRNA screen to track the behaviour of adult stem/progenitor cells derived from human mammary epithelial cells grown in 3D cultures. We identified miR-106a-3p, which enriches the adult stem cell-like lineage and promotes the expansion of 3D cultures. Transcriptomic analysis showed that this miRNA regulates transcription factors such as REST, CBFB, NF-YA, and GATA3, thereby enhancing the maintenance of adult stem/progenitor cells in human epithelial cells.

Despite utilizing a variety of transport methods, MFS transporters are believed to undergo similar con-formational changes within their distinct transport cycles. Although the similarities regarding conformational changes between the classes of MFS transporters are note-worthy, the differences are also valuable because they may explain the distinct functions of the classes within the MFS. Here, we have performed a variety of equilibrium and non-equilibrium all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the bacterial proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter (GkPOT) and the human glucose transporter 1 (GluT1). To compare the similarities and differences of the conformational dynamics found within the three different classes of transporters we have also referenced previous simulations involving the glycerol-3-phosphate (GlpT) transporter. All of the proteins discussed here were simulated in the apo state in explicit membrane environments. Our results suggest a very similar conformational transition for all transporter types involving interbundle salt-bridge formation/disruption coupled with the orientation changes of transmembrane (TM) helices, specifically H1/H7 and H5/H11, resulting in an alternation in the accessibility of water at the cyto- and periplasmic gates.\",\"isPreprint\":true,\"firstAuthorId\":1,\"lastAuthorId\":2,\"authorList\":\"Ogden, D.; Immadisetty, K.; Sauve, S.; Moradi, M.\",\"slug\":\"slug-default\",\"server\":\"biorxiv\"},{\"articleId\":5,\"title\":\"Oscillatory multi-timescale mechanisms underlying multisensory sequence prediction\",\"institution\":\"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf\",\"date\":\"2024-10-29T01:55:19.099Z\",\"link\":\"10.1101/778969\",\"abstract\":\"Neural oscillations have been proposed to be involved in predictive processing, however less addressed in the multisensory context. In the present study, we recorded cortical activity using magnetoencephalography during an audiovisual serial prediction task in which participants had to acquire stimulus sequences and to monitor whether subsequent probe items complied with the sequence. In a given trial, either visual or auditory features of the bimodal stimuli were task-relevant. Task-related changes of power and coupling of neural oscillations were analyzed using a data-driven clustering approach. We observed prediction-related theta-band coupling in a network involving the cingulate, premotor, prefrontal, and superior temporal regions. The behavioral performance of participants varied as a function of the phase delay of the coupling between different regions in this network. Two additional clusters were detected in which beta power was stronger if the previous or the following stimuli were the same as the current one in the sequence. These clusters interacted with the theta-band prediction network through cross-frequency coupling. Our results offer novel insights into the multi-timescale neural dynamics underlying multisensory predictions, suggesting that oscillations in multiple frequency ranges, as well as coupling within and across frequencies, may be critical for multisensory sequence processing.\",\"isPreprint\":true,\"firstAuthorId\":1,\"lastAuthorId\":2,\"authorList\":\"Wang, P.; Maÿe, A.; Daume, J.; Xue, G.; Engel, A.

Cul3 engages dozens of adaptor proteins to recruit hundreds of substrates for ubiquitination, but the adaptors that impact sleep and synapses remain ill-defined. Here we implicate Insomniac (Inc), a conserved protein required for normal sleep and synaptic homeostasis in Drosophila, as a Cul3 adaptor. Inc binds Cul3 in vivo, and mutations within the N-terminal BTB domain of Inc that weaken Inc-Cul3 associations impair Inc activity, indicating that Inc function requires binding to the Cul3 complex. Deletion of the conserved C-terminus of Inc does not alter Cul3 binding but abolishes Inc activity in the context of sleep and synaptic homeostasis, suggesting that the C-terminal domain of Inc is a substrate recruitment domain. Mutation of a conserved, disease-associated arginine in the Inc C-terminus also abolishes Inc function, suggesting that this residue is vital for recruiting Inc targets. Inc levels are negatively regulated by Cul3 in neurons, consistent with Inc degradation by autocatalytic ubiquitination, a hallmark of Cullin adaptors. These findings link Inc and Cul3 in vivo and indicate that Cul3-Inc complexes are essential for normal sleep and synaptic function. Furthermore, these results indicate that dysregulation of conserved substrates of Cul3-Inc complexes may contribute to altered sleep and synaptic function in autism and schizophrenia associated with Cul3 mutations.\",\"isPreprint\":true,\"firstAuthorId\":1,\"lastAuthorId\":2,\"authorList\":\"Li, Q.; Lim, K.

Although the precise molecular pathways involved in the regulation of stem and progenitor cell fate remain unknown, it is widely accepted that transcription factors play a crucial role as intrinsic regulators in these fate decisions. In this study, we carried out a microRNA screen to track the behaviour of adult stem/progenitor cells derived from human mammary epithelial cells grown in 3D cultures. We identified miR-106a-3p, which enriches the adult stem cell-like lineage and promotes the expansion of 3D cultures. Transcriptomic analysis showed that this miRNA regulates transcription factors such as REST, CBFB, NF-YA, and GATA3, thereby enhancing the maintenance of adult stem/progenitor cells in human epithelial cells. These data reveal a clear transcriptional program that governs the maintenance of adult stem/progenitor cells and controls their fate.\",\"isPreprint\":true,\"firstAuthorId\":1,\"lastAuthorId\":2,\"authorList\":\"Robert, J.; Vlachavas, E.-I.; Lemaitre, G.; Chatziioannou, A.; Puceat, M.; Delom, F.; Fessart, D.\",\"slug\":\"slug-default\",\"server\":\"biorxiv\"},{\"articleId\":1,\"title\":\"Plants with purple abaxial leaves: A repository of metrics from stomata distribution.\",\"institution\":\"Universidade de Sao Paulo (USP-Sao Carlos)\",\"date\":\"2024-10-29T01:55:19.092Z\",\"link\":\"10.1101/294553\",\"abstract\":\"Plants with purple abaxial leaf surfaces are very common in nature but the ecophysiological aspects of this phenotype are not well known. We observed here that the purple color of the abaxial tegument in living leaves make stomata completely visible. Based in it we measured the relations between stomatic density, celular area and distance between stomata pairs and observed a general log-normal trend line between density x celular area and density x interstomatic distance. These data shows that measures of stomatic distances at purple abaxial leaves are able to be a sensor to environmental changes of living purple plants. In future ecophysiological inferences will be established from the information brought by the measurements of the distance between stomata in purple plants.\",\"isPreprint\":true,\"firstAuthorId\":1,\"lastAuthorId\":2,\"authorList\":\"Almeida Filho, H.
